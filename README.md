# Properati Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from the real estate website Properati.com, which includes information on 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico. The goal is to determine whether property size or location has a stronger influence on sale prices.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main notebooks: Data_Cleaning.ipynb and Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb. These notebooks cover different stages of the data analysis process.

1. **Data_Cleaning.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on data cleaning and preparation. It includes the following steps: - Importing the dataset from CSV files. - Handling missing values and outliers. - Standardizing data formats. - Removing duplicates. - Creating new features or transforming existing ones if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on exploring and analyzing the cleaned dataset. It includes the following steps: - Visualizing the distributions of variables. - Investigating relationships between property size, location, and sale prices through various plots. - Calculating summary statistics. - Conducting correlation analysis.

## File Structure

The project contains the following files:

- **Data folder**: This folder contains the dataset files in CSV format. The dataset files may include multiple files or a single file with all the data.

- **Data_Cleaning.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for the data cleaning and preparation steps. It guides you through the process of loading the dataset, cleaning the data, and transforming variables if needed.

- **Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for the exploratory data analysis phase. It helps you explore the cleaned dataset, visualize the variables, and analyze the relationships between property size, location, and sale prices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Download or obtain the dataset files in CSV format.

2. Open the Data_Cleaning.ipynb notebook to clean and prepare the dataset. Execute the code cells step by step, following the instructions and comments provided. Save the cleaned dataset if necessary.

3. Open the Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb notebook to explore and analyze the cleaned dataset. Execute the code cells to generate visualizations, calculate summary statistics, and perform correlation analysis.

4. Analyze the results, interpret the findings, and draw conclusions based on the data analysis.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

Make sure these dependencies are installed in your Python environment to run the code successfully.

## Conclusion

The Properati Data Analysis Project provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset from the real estate website Properati.com. By cleaning the data and conducting exploratory data analysis, the project aims to uncover insights into the factors influencing property sale prices in Mexico. The project's two notebooks, Data_Cleaning.ipynb and Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb, guide you through the process, allowing you to gain a better understanding of the dataset and draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis.
